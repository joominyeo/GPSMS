GPSMS, a combination of GPS + SMS, is a low-cost tracking hardware that uses test messaging to track your vehicle.

##According to the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI, and Uniform Crime Reports statistics, more than three quarters of a million cars were stolen in 2016 alone. Inspired by a friend who got his car stolen couple months ago, our final project, GPSMS, will provide a low cost and effective solution to vehicle theft. 
Through this project, we hope to provide car owners with a peace of mind and ability to know where the location of their car at all times. This will help drivers to not only react to theft in a fast and safe manner--rather than chasing down the car themselves--but also have preventative measures to keep the cars secure. In addition, GPSMS can do simple, everyday task such as helping users pinpoint the location of their vehicle in a large parking lot. 
Furthermore, with the ability to log accelerometer data, the arduino will have the ability to safe drive data in case of an accident. This will help drivers prove that they have been maneuvering in a safe or unsafe manner should there be a need to prove the driving style of the driver.
Although this project was initially developed to help the users track the location of the car in real-time, it can be extended to tracking other commonly stolen, lost, or misplaced items.
